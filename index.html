                   <p>Hello! My name is Pavel Zapolski. I came to the United Stated about 10 years ago from Eastern
                    Europe.
                    My country is located right between Poland and Russia. It's a small country and if you open the map
                    of eastern Europe
                    you'll find out the name of it.<br>

                    As soon as I came here, I started taking English classes. It was difficult at first but it was a lot
                    of fun.
                    Learning something new is always exciting, especially when you learn a new language. After finishing
                    all the ESL classes (English As a Second Language),
                    I began taking classes for my major which was business administration.
                    And soon after I graduated from Bucks County Community College with an Associate degree.
                    The next big event in my academic life happened when I graduated from Temple University with
                    Bachelor's Degree in Marketing.
                    If you ask me why I chose marketing as a major, I will not be able to answer you that question.
                    Maybe my teachers were teaching the courses so well that I decided to stick to the major.
                    Maybe, material of the course was very interesting. Perhaps, combination of those two factors.
                    But when I got my first job I was certain that this is not for me.
                    After about 6 month of thinking and going through a lot of choices what to do as well as talking to
                    my friends and colleagues,
                    I finally decided to dive into the IT world. And to be honest, the more I get into it the more I
                    love it.</p>
